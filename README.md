# Simple-CAPTCHA-Auto-Filler---Chrome-Extension
This Chrome Extension automatically detects and solves simple math-based CAPTCHAs (e.g., “5 + 3”) by parsing and calculating the answer, then autofilling it. It requires no machine learning and is intended for educational use to demonstrate how weak CAPTCHAs can be bypassed with basic automation.
